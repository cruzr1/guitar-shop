  descriptions: [
    'Offering a clear and versatile tone suitable for playing a wide range of music without the need for extreme adjustments, the perfect bass for aspiring bassists that enjoy playing a wide selection of music',
    'No other bass looks like it or plays like it. The beloved Thunderbird bass from Epiphone features the reverse body styling, carved top and dual bass Humbucker pickups, set off with black hardware and Thunderbird insignia on the pickguard.',
    'A spruce top marries perfectly to the T5 Standard’s (T5-S) fully-hollow sapele body, yielding tons of acoustic resonance and electric horsepower. Run the T5 through an acoustic and electric amp and work the five-way switch to hear exactly what this guitar can do.',
    'Dave Friedman is the man behind the signature tones of rock icons Eddie Van Halen, Steve Stevens, Jerry Cantrell, Phil X and Bill Kelliher to name a few. Dave Friedman has been building, modding and repairing music equipment for many of the world’s biggest stars for the past 25 years.',
    'Epiphone’s first Masterbilt archtops quickly rose to popularity during the 1930s “Big Band” era and were renowned for their warm woody tone, wide tonal range and punchy volume. However, with the invention of the electric guitar pickup, archtop acoustic guitars quickly became equipped with magnetic amplification and were for the most part, forever transformed into “electric” guitars.',
    'The Jackson X Series Dinky DK3XR HSS is an attention-grabbing axe that is built for high speed, shred-heavy mayhem, and it certainly evokes a certain decade of big hair and big solos as it does so.',
    'Martin are one of the best known names in the acoustic guitar world and with very good reason. They have been inspiring guitarists for generations and have remained a prominent figure throughout decades of music style changes.',
    'The DGT (David Grissom Trem) is the result of more than 20 years of collaboration between Paul Smith and David Grissom. The DGT is based on the McCarty with a unique DGT neck shape, taller frets, special pickups, and a revised control layout. '
